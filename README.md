# first-semester
okay so i already described this but i have no problem saying it again!
this repository is for the files and stuff i've been working on with github for my first 4 months!
they might be pretty basic considering im new and not a pro, but that does't matter!
if you have feedback on what i can improve feel free to contact me!!
